# Gym News API

-   This is the back end that powers the Gym News Front End web app. There are a
    number of models and controllers in use here, specifically:

    -   bulletins
    -   climbs
    -   favorites
    -   gyms
    -   users

-   A number of models are slated to be added to these, including:

    -   ascents
    -   subscriptions

-   All of this is to create an intuitive user experience for creating and
    accessing updates from a gym.
